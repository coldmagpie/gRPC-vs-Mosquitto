## Overview
This project demonstrates the integration of gRPC and MQTT communication protocols within a .NET application. It includes benchmark tests to measure the performance of sending messages through both gRPC and MQTT. The project also utilizes Docker Compose to manage microservices.

## Features
- **gRPC Communication**: Implements gRPC for efficient remote procedure calls.
- **MQTT Communication**: Uses MQTT for lightweight messaging between devices.
- **Benchmarking**: Uses BenchmarkDotNet to measure the performance of gRPC and MQTT operations.
- **Docker Compose**: Manages microservices and their dependencies using Docker Compose.
